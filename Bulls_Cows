# Program to Solve Bulls and Cows Game ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows )

# Things Learned:
# Always check the datatype which is expected:
#   If the numbers were int instead of string then loop would have changed as int is not a iterable
# In dictionary if you add a same key again, then it overrides the previous one
# Intialising a list in Python cannot be done like an array in C/Java.
# Test cases is what makes a problem harder to solve.
